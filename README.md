### Requirements for building and running
- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle 2.8 or higher
- An account in [vk.com](https://vk.com) that is not a pity to lose (admins are struggling with fake accounts and it can be banned)

### How to build, configure and run
For **building the project** use Gradle. Go to the root project directory and run `gradle dist` command. It will generate zip archive in *build\dist* directory. Extract it somewhere and script is almost ready for running (just need to link it with your VK account and setup some properties).

Now about the **configuration**.
First, you need to have an account in vk.com, which you'll use for running the script. I would recommend to use an account that is not a pity to lose, because it can be banned for "strange activity".
The next thing you need to do - to configure some script properties. Go to *conf* directory and find there *vkb.properties* file. Here is an example of configured properties - [vkb.properties](https://gist.github.com/gleb-kosteiko/d5a4e2c6b40104d88e45). There are five **required properties**:

-  *current.user.id* - identification number of your account.
-  *application.id* - identification number of application (it's used for API requests to vk.com).
-  *access.token* - the key that is used for access your application to vk.com API.
- *communities.search.words* - comma-separated list of key words, which will be used for searching of competition communities (e.g. *competition,gifts,prizes*).
-  *post.classification.model* - the model that allow identify competition posts.

Full list of properties, descriptions and example values you can find [here](https://github.com/gleb-kosteiko/vkb/blob/master/properties.md). 


Also there is [Dockerfile](https://github.com/gleb-kosteiko/docker-vkb) for VKB.
